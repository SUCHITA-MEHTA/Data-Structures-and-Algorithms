# Data Structures and Algorithms
Here is the repository of all the data structures and algorithms I have implemented. All the implementations are in java.

1) LinkedLists:
It has a complete implementation of the singly linked list ADT including the following 8 operations on a linked list:
a) Insert a node at head
b) Insert a node at end
c) Insert a node at a given position
d) Delete a node from head
e) Delete a node from end
f) Delete a node at a given position
g) Delete a node by a given value
h) Return the total number of nodes in a linked list

2) Stack:
It has an implementation of the push and pop functions.

3) Queue:
It has an implementation of the Enqueue, Dequque and Display functions.

Star the repo if you find it useful!
